Easy Brownie Ingredients
You likely already have the ingredients you'll need for these easy brownies on hand:

· Sugar: These easy brownies start with two cups of white sugar.
· Flour: All-purpose flour creates structure in the batter.
· Butter: Two sticks of melted butter give the brownies moisture and richness.
· Eggs: Eggs lend even more moisture. Plus, they help bind the batter together.
· Cocoa powder: Of course, you'll need cocoa powder for chocolate brownies!
· Vanilla: Vanilla extract enhances the overall flavor of the brownies.
· Baking powder: Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it helps the brownies rise.
· Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients.
· Walnuts: Nuts are optional, of course, but they add a welcome crunch.

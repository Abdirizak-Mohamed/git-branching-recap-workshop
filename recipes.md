Ingredients:

8 oz elbow macaroni
2 tbsp butter
2 tbsp flour
2 cups milk
2 cups shredded cheddar cheese
Salt and pepper to taste
Instructions:

Cook the macaroni according to package instructions until it's al dente, then drain and set aside.
In a large saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
Add the flour to the melted butter and whisk together until smooth. Cook for 1-2 minutes until the mixture turns golden brown.
Slowly pour in the milk, whisking constantly to prevent lumps from forming. Cook for another 2-3 minutes until the sauce thickens.
Add the shredded cheddar cheese to the sauce and stir until the cheese is melted and the sauce is smooth.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
Pour the cheese sauce over the cooked macaroni and stir until the macaroni is evenly coated with sauce.
Serve hot and enjoy!
Optional: If you want to give your mac and cheese a crispy topping, sprinkle some breadcrumbs over the top and bake in the oven at 350Â°F for 10-15 minutes until golden brown.

Ingredients:

10 kg of fruits (e.g. plums, apples, pears, quince)
5 L of water
2 kg of sugar
Yeast
Instructions:

Clean and wash the fruits thoroughly, remove any stems, leaves or seeds.
Crush the fruits to extract their juice or put them in a clean container with a narrow neck and use a wooden stick to crush them.
Put the fruit juice in a large pot and add water and sugar. Mix everything together and let it rest for several hours.
After the mixture has rested, add yeast and mix again.
Cover the pot with a clean cloth and let it ferment for a week in a warm, dry place.
After a week, use a sieve or cheesecloth to filter the liquid and remove any solid particles.
Transfer the liquid into a clean barrel or large glass jars and let it age for several months in a cool, dark place.
Taste the palinca after a few months to see if it has the desired strength and flavor. If it needs more aging, let it sit for a few more months until it reaches the desired taste and strength.
Once it's ready, pour the palinca into bottles and enjoy responsibly!
Note: Making palinca requires some experience and knowledge to ensure safety and quality, as it involves high alcohol content and the use of equipment like a still. If you're not experienced with making spirits, it's recommended to consult with an expert or purchase palinca from a trusted source.

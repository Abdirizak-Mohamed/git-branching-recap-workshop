##Bigos stew
Ingredients
50g/1¾oz butter
1 onion, sliced
1 tsp juniper berries, crushed
½ tsp caraway seeds
300g/10½oz lean pork belly, cubed
1 tbsp brown sugar
500g/1lb 2oz sauerkraut
half a white cabbage, shredded
200g/7oz fresh chopped tomatoes or 400g tin tomatoes
500ml/18fl oz chicken or beef stock
10g/¼oz dried mushrooms
300g/10½oz smoked Polish sausage, such as kabanas, chopped
1 apple, grated


Melt the butter in a large casserole. Add the onion and sauté over a medium heat until the onion is softened and translucent. Sprinkle over the juniper berries and caraway, then add the pork. Sprinkle over the brown sugar. Turn the heat up high for a couple of minutes, turning the meat so it browns well.

Drain the sauerkraut well and give it a rinse if you want to reduce the vinegar flavour. The easiest thing to do is squeeze it out with your hands. Add to the casserole with the white cabbage and chopped tomatoes, then pour over the stock. Simmer for about 30 minutes.

Soak the dried mushrooms in warm water. When they have softened, drain, adding their soaking liquor to the casserole. Chop the mushrooms finely and add these to the casserole, along with the sausage and apple.

Simmer for a further hour and a half and serve or cover overnight and reheat the following day.

Here is a recipe for a classic vanilla cake:

Ingredients:

2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup unsalted butter, softened
1 3/4 cups granulated sugar
4 large eggs
2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract
1 cup whole milk
Instructions:

Preheat the oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour two 9-inch (23cm) cake pans and set aside.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.
Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla extract.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, alternating with the milk. Begin and end with the dry ingredients.
Mix until just combined, being careful not to overmix.
Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cake pans.
Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
Let the cakes cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing them from the pans and allowing them to cool completely on a wire rack.
Frost and decorate the cake as desired.
Enjoy your delicious vanilla cake!

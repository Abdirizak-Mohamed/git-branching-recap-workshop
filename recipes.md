## Abdi Mohamed - Anjero
### Ingredients
- 1 cup white corn flour
- ½ cup sorghum flour
- 1 Tbsp Instant dry yeast
- 4 cups self-raising flour
- ¼ cup sugar
- 1 tsp salt
- 4 cups lukewarm water

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, mix the white corn meal, sorghum flour, yeast and half of the water, making sure it is properly combined. Leave for one hour.
2. After one hour add in the self-rising flour and sugar, then slowly start adding the remaining water as you mix to get a smooth, lump-less texture for your batter.
3. The key to achieving the classic anjero taste is fermentation. The mix should rest in a warm place to allow the fermentation to take place. 4. The minimum time would be a few hours but to achieve a more authentic, sour anjero taste, you can let the batter ferment for up to two days. For this recipe you can let the batter ferment overnight.
5. In a non-stick frying pan on a medium heat, ladle the batter mix into the pan according to preferred portion size, making sure that the batter spreads fully across the surface of the pan.
6. Cover the pan and cook for a few minutes per portion. The desired colour is a golden brown, and the texture should be spongy with no liquid remaining.
7. Plate the pancake and continue process until you each person has around 3 each.
8. Refrigerate leftover batter and use for lunch or for tomorrow’s breakfast.

Basic Biscuit Dough

INGREDIENTS
90g

Butter (unsalted) (softened)
100g

Billington's Unrefined Golden Caster Sugar
1

Egg(s) (free range)
0.5 tsp

Nielsen-Massey Vanilla Extract
300g

Allinson's Plain White Flour
0.5 tsp

Baking powder
0.5 tsp

Salt

METHOD

Step 1:
Sieve the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl and set aside.

Step 2:
In a large bowl cream the butter and sugar until pale. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.

Step 3:
Add the flour to the butter mix and mix until the dough is formed. Wrap the biscuit dough in clingfilm and chill for at least one hour.

Step 4:
Preheat the oven to 170°C (150°C fan, gas mark 3). Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to about 0.5cm.

Step 5:
Cut out the biscuits and transfer to baking sheet. Roll up the trimmings and repeat stages above to make more biscuits. Bake for 8 – 12 minutes until golden.

Step 6:
Remove and transfer to a cooling wire and leave until completely cool before decorating.

Step 7:
The baked biscuits can be stored in an air tight container and are best eaten within 1-2 days. Alternatively, freeze your biscuit dough (wrapped in cling film) for up to 2 months. Allow to defrost in the fridge before baking.
